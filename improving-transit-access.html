    <h1><span class="large-text">Improving </span>Transit Access</h1>
    <p>Through its Local Technical Assistance program, CMAP collaborated with the Developing Communities Project and the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) on a project highlighting the many quality-of-life benefits of the proposed CTA Red Line South Extension, which would extend the Red Line from its current terminus at the 95th Street Station four stops to 130th Street.</p>
    <p>The following video depicts how the proposed transit project would improve the lives of Greater Roseland residents.  GO TO 2040 recommends building the CTA Red Line South Extension because it would:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase access to jobs.</li>
      <li>Streamline multiple CTA and Pace bus-to-rail connections for routes south of 95th Street, substantially reducing travel times.</li>
      <li>Generate a catalytic economic impact in a highly distressed area of the south side of Chicago -- the Greater Roseland community.</li>
    </ul>
