  <h1><span class="large-text">Local Technical</span> Assistance program</h1>
  <p>CMAP launched a Local Technical Assistance (LTA) program in March 2011, with support from a three-year, $4.25 million competitive grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as part of the federal interagency Partnership for Sustainable Communities.</p>
  <p>Through the LTA program, CMAP staff are helping communities to implement the GO TO 2040 comprehensive regional plan. This overview video features several of the initial projects, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Comprehensive plan for the Village of Campton Hills</li>
    <li>Land use planning and redevelopment of the old Joliet Prison site</li>
    <li>Green and Healthy Neighborhood Plan for the City of Chicago's neighborhoods of Englewood, Washington Park, and Woodlawn</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>Nearly 100 projects have been initiated since the program's inception.</p>
