    <h1>Supporting Sustainable <span class="large-text">Local Foods</span></h1>
    <p>A sustainable local food system is an economic network in which food production, processing, distribution, access, consumption, and resource/waste recovery (composting) are tied to a geographic region, such as northeastern Illinois.</p>

    <ul class="cycles">
      <li><h2>Production</h2><p>Activities related to growing and harvesting food and other agricultural products. Production includes soil preparation, planting, weeding and pest control, irrigation, and harvesting. Production can also include the washing and preparing of produce for transport and sale.</p></li>
      <li><h2>Processing</h2><p>Preparing and converting agricultural products for sale and consumption. This can include washing and packaging, as well as converting raw agricultural products into other types of consumables such as sauces, fruit preserves, soups, salsa, and juice.</p></li>
      <li><h2>Distribution</h2><p>Moving food from the farm to the point of sale, such as a farmstand, farmers' market, grocery store, on-line grocer warehouse, or other location. Distribution may also include the aggregation of food from different farms into a warehouse or cold storage prior to going to market.</p></li>
      <li><h2>Access</h2><p>The place where people purchase their food, such as farmstands, markets, or restaurants.</p></li>
      <li><h2>Consumption</h2><p>Preparing and eating local food! Yum!</p></li>
      <li><h2>Resource/Waste Recovery</h2><p>Also known as composting, this is the reclamation of unconsumed food or other agricultural waste that can be broken down and returned to the farm fields as a source of nutrients and fertilizer.</p></li>
