    <h1><span class="large-text">GO TO 2040 Portrait: </span>Geoffrey Baer</h1>
    <p>For years, Geoffrey Baer has reported on the unique communities of metropolitan Chicago.  His video tours are a staple of WTTW-TV, giving residents a televised glimpse of their own hometowns and parts of the region that they have yet to visit.  In person, he conveys a combined sense of history and progress that helps people think differently about where and how they live.</p>
