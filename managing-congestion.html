      <li>At the access points, signs indicate the toll charged to travel certain distances. Prices are set to ensure smooth traffic flow and reliable speeds in the express lanes. Transit vehicles and registered carpools typically ride free or at a discount.</li>
      <li>After a driver enters the express toll lanes, an overhead device reads the vehicle's electronic transponder and automatically charges the toll - similar to the Illinois Tollway's open road tolling system.</li>

      <h1><span class="large-text">Managing </span>Congestion</h1>
      <p>Congestion in the Chicago region costs drivers time, money, and patience. Building expressway capacity is critical to handle our traffic, but construction cannot relieve congestion completely, especially with growth in traffic over time. A new strategy is needed, one that gives drivers the option to avoid congestion.</p>
      <p>As recommended by GO TO 2040, it is time for our region to implement congestion pricing, with express toll lanes that will help manage traffic and give drivers better choices for getting around.</p>
      <p>Click on the numbers to see how congestion pricing works.</p>
