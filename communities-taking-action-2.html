    <h1><span class="large-text">Planning Locally</span> for Livability</h1>
    <p>The following video takes a deeper dive into projects developed through CMAPâ€™s Local Technical Assistance (LTA) program.  "Planning Locally for Livability" highlights the benefits of municipalities' planning comprehensively. As of 2010, nearly half of surveyed municipalities in northeastern Illinois had not adopted a comprehensive plan in the last ten years. Through the LTA program, many municipalities -- both old and new -- are creating or updating comprehensive and sustainability plans to guide decisions for increased livability. The video focuses on comprehensive plans developed by Blue Island and Campton Hills, and on the sustainability plan prepared by Park Forest.</p>
