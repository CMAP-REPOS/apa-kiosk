    <h1><span class="large-text">GO TO 2040</span></h1>
    <p>Metropolitan Chicago is one of the world's great economic centers, but we cannot afford to take our quality of life for granted. To address anticipated population growth of more than 2 million new residents, GO TO 2040 establishes coordinated strategies that help the region's 284 communities and seven counties address transportation, housing, economic development, open space, the environment, and other quality-of-life issues. The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) developed and now guides the implementation of GO TO 2040, metropolitan Chicago's first comprehensive regional plan in more than 100 years.</p>
