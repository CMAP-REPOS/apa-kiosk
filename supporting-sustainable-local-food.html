      <h1>Supporting Sustainable <span class="large-text">Local Foods</span></h1>
      <p>Illinois has some of the most fertile soils in the country.  While Illinois farmers grow only six percent of the produce consumed in the state, we could grow much more. If local food production were increased in the seven counties of metropolitan Chicago, it could create over 5,000 jobs and generate $6.5 billion a year in economic activity.</p>
      <p>GO TO 2040 calls for us to strengthen our region's food systems. By producing more of the food we consume locally, we keep money in the region, support local businesses, and have delicious, fresh produce to eat.  The microsite www.cmap.illinois.gov/food provides a number of resources to help local governments support our local food systems.</p>
